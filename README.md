# EDv20TestCode
Test code for 2018 Robot
This is the test code for driving the 2018 robot.  There are a lot of defines and declarations in this code that match the final bot.  
Additionally pay attention to the #defines in the top of the file because they determine what parts of the code will be live at
build time.

While not the intention, this could be the actual code to drive the bot if we can't get the RobotBuilder code to work properly.
